# HELLO

hello dad, my name isa fartaglockalous and i am from the planet wsnarclkle. it is a fart to meet you here at this fine r3esort on the remote island of guggglabunnbun

Hello fartaglockalous. May I ask how you know that you are my daughter or son or whatever you are? You call me dad, yet you come from a planet I've never heard of. How can this be?


well, were i come from (wsb=narclkle) we call our femenen elders dad and our male elders mom, therefor you are my dad.

I see. So I gave birth to you. That is an even bigger mystery. Surely I would have remembered giving birth to an alien?

oh dad, I never said that you gave birth to me, on my planet we call ALL our elders either mom, or dad, exept our birth givers who are named grax and greyx. love ya, peace out

I love you too, I think? I mean, I beleive in loving people, but I don't normally say that to strangers. What do you do for fun on wsnarclkle?

ahhhhhy, i see the confusion, on my planet we do not say "love ya" because we love you, we say it after every third statment in a conversation. do you get it? anyway, you asked me "what do i do for fun on my planet" its a funny qustion because if you simply asked me why i was here, in your house, at the beginging of our conversation, you would know the answer, we like to go to earth and colect peoples head to play gananish with, it is a game on my plantet, sorrta like hockey and cricket mixed together.

Oh how fun! I love games too. Can you tell the the rules? Love ya.

i think your missing t5he big picture, i came here to bite your head of sean.

Goodness me! On my planet, we normally don't mix violent plans with polite conversation. I do not wish to have my head bitten off. On my planet, we frown on death. It;s not something you can normally recover from.
